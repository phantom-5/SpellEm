# SpellEm

## My first android project

Basically I was making this while I was learning to make android apps for the first time using android studio.

## What is this app ?

A game.

## How does the game work ?

The game displays words , that you need to spell , but every time you get one right, the orientation of keys on the keyboard changes.
You have to get max number of words right while the count down times counts from 30.

## Issues ?

Proper way to generate actual words.
Proper way to have a keyboard with random orientation
Doesnt work on every device as of now
